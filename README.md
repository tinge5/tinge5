# Turner Inge

## Overview
I am currently a student at Villanova University pursuing a Masters In Software Engineering. I graduated in 3.5 years with a bachelors in Computer Science. I am passionate about coding and exploring new technologies, driven by seeing projects evolve from an idea into a working solution. Whether that is building machine learning models, interactive games, web applications, or anything related to the field. I take joy in the journey of software development. Taking an idea, and seeing it come to life.

## Projects
### NFL Game Outcome Predictor 
**Technologies**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Scikit-learn
* Built a machine learning pipeline to predict NFL game winners using 342k+ play-by-play records (2009–2016).

* Aggregated play-level data into team-season averages and engineered matchup features while removing outcome-leaking variables.

* Trained multiple models (Logistic Regression, SVM, MLP, Decision Tree); Logistic Regression achieved 66% accuracy and 0.73 AUC.

* Generated probabilistic predictions for future/hypothetical matchups, with visualizations of feature importance, ROC curves, and confusion matrices.
